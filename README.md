# findHash
Find sha256 hash

note : run this code with localserver

The following code will search for a hash that matches the input using a 2-thread method. The first thread will hash odd numbers and the second thread will hash even numbers. In each thread, the hash will be matched with the digits entered in the input form.

*The more digits entered, the longer the process will take to find the hash.*
